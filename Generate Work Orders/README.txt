==DESCRIPTION==
This projects demonstrates my advancement of object oriented programming as well as understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.
Given 100 employees and roughly 1000 customers (data given via CSV files),
the goal is to generate work orders such that each employee has rougly the same amount of work orders as the other employees (about 10).
Customer ticket and Employee data are in their
own respective CSV files. There is a log file within the directory for debugging, and the output will be a CSV file with the employees and their work order tickets.
(See workorder_data for example output.)
File and IO exceptions are handled. 
 
 ==DIRECTIONS==
 Ensure files are in project directory and file names are correctly entered. Compiling will append to the log file and output workorder_data.
